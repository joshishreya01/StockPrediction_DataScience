# StockPrediction_DataScience
Sure, here's a summary explanation of the stock market prediction project:

1. Library Imports:
   - Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and building the LSTM model, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `tensorflow`.

2. Data Loading:
   - Load the stock market dataset, which includes 'Date' and 'Close' prices.

3. Data Preprocessing:
   - Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format and set it as the DataFrame index.
   - Extract and reshape the 'Close' prices for further processing.

4. Data Normalization:
   - Normalize the 'Close' prices to a range between 0 and 1 using `MinMaxScaler`. This helps improve the performance and speed of the LSTM model.

5. Data Splitting:
   - Split the normalized data into training and testing sets, typically with an 80-20 split.

6. Dataset Preparation for LSTM:
   - Create a function to generate sequences of a specified length (`time_step`) from the data. Each sequence will be used to predict the next time step's value.

7. Reshape Data:
   - Reshape the prepared sequences to the format required by LSTM: [samples, time steps, features].

8. Model Building:
   - Construct an LSTM model using the `Sequential` class from `tensorflow.keras`.
   - Add LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies, followed by Dense layers to map the learned features to the output.

9. Model Compilation:
   - Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function, preparing it for training.

10. Model Training:
    - Train the LSTM model on the training data for a specified number of epochs and batch size. 

11. Making Predictions:
    - Use the trained model to make predictions on both the training and testing datasets.

12. Inverse Scaling:
    - Transform the predicted values back to the original scale using the inverse of the normalization process, making them comparable to the actual 'Close' prices.

13. Performance Evaluation:
    - Calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the model's accuracy on both training and testing datasets.

14. Visualization:
    - Plot the original 'Close' prices along with the model's predictions for training and testing data. This visual comparison helps assess how well the model has captured the underlying trends in the stock prices.

This project demonstrates a basic approach to time series forecasting using LSTM, suitable for predicting stock market prices based on historical data.
